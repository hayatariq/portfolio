            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>
            Credit Buddy was developed as part of CSC396, a studio-based course centered on
            iterative, user-centered design. The project was completed in a team of five and
            progressed from early research to a fully tested high-fidelity prototype.
            </p>

            <h4>Research & Problem Definition</h4>
            <p>
            The project began with individual literature reviews examining financial literacy,
            credit behavior, and systemic barriers to understanding credit. These findings were
            synthesized to identify a core problem: young adults lack accessible and trustworthy
            tools for managing credit.
            </p>

            <p>
            Primary research was conducted with a defined and reachable target audience through
            interviews and surveys. Results were analyzed collaboratively to extract key themes,
            pain points, and behavioral insights, which informed the design guidelines.
            </p>

            <h4>Design & Iteration</h4>
            <p>
            Each team member independently created low-fidelity prototypes, which were informally
            usability tested. Insights from testing were combined to develop a unified
            high-fidelity prototype in Figma.
            </p>

            <p>
            Formal usability testing was conducted on the high-fidelity prototype, and the design
            was iterated based on findings related to clarity, terminology, and user trust.
            </p>

            <h4>Deliverables</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Research summaries and synthesized insights</li>
            <li>Low- and high-fidelity prototypes</li>

            <h4>Context & Goal</h4>
            <p>
                Adora is a conceptual clothing brand developed to explore how a personal resale
                business can be translated into a cohesive online retail experience. The project
                focused on defining a clear brand identity, visual language, and user flow for an
                independent fashion website.
            </p>

            <h4>Brand Exploration</h4>
            <p>
                The goal was to articulate a consistent aesthetic that reflected the curated,
                vintage-inspired nature of the clothing. I explored typography, color palettes,
                layout hierarchy, and editorial-style imagery to create a brand that felt
                intentional and cohesive rather than purely transactional.
            </p>

            <h4>Design Process</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Defined brand values and visual direction based on existing product curation</li>
                <li>Designed homepage, product listings, and editorial-style sections</li>
                <li>Used real product images from my Depop shop to ground the prototype</li>
                <li>Incorporated placeholder lifestyle imagery to communicate mood and atmosphere</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>
                The final deliverable is a high-fidelity website prototype that demonstrates
                branding, visual design, and layout decisions for a small-scale fashion brand,
                with an emphasis on storytelling and aesthetic cohesion.
            </p>

            <p class="project-note">
                <strong>Note:</strong> Product images are from my Depop shop. Lifestyle and banner
                imagery was used as visual reference material to communicate design intent.

                <h4>Context & Purpose</h4>
                <p>
                This project examines one of the most infamous unsolved art thefts in history, mapping
                the museum layout and sequencing key events before, during, and after the 1990 heist. 
                The goal is to provide an interactive, narrative-driven exploration of the crime scene and investigative findings.
                </p>

                <h4>Research & Design Approach</h4>
                <p>
                We gathered historical records, crime scene reports, and museum documentation to reconstruct
                events. Using Omeka and Neatline, we designed a timeline and spatial interface to guide users
                through the sequence of events. The project emphasizes information hierarchy, interpretive storytelling,
                and intuitive exploration.
                </p>

                <h4>User Experience & Interaction</h4>
                <p>
                Users can navigate the museum layout, view event annotations, and explore temporal sequences
                interactively. Design decisions prioritized clarity, pacing, and meaningful engagement with
                complex spatial and temporal data.
                </p>

                <h4>Deliverables</h4>
                <p>
                Interactive Omeka + Neatline project, curated timeline and map annotations, and documentation
                of research and design decisions.

            <p>
            This project analyzed TTC subway delay incidents from 2020–2024 to identify systemic
            patterns in delay frequency, duration, and causes. The analysis focused on temporal trends,
            station-level disruption, and the role of passenger-related incidents in overall service
            reliability.
            </p>

            <h4>Data Preparation & Analysis</h4>
            <p>
            The dataset was cleaned and standardized to resolve inconsistent station names, timestamps,
            and delay codes. Delay causes were grouped into passenger-related, system-related, and
            fire/weather-related categories to support comparative analysis across time and locations.
            </p>

            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <p>
            Results showed a steady increase in total delay minutes over time, with passenger-related
            incidents accounting for the majority of disruptions. Major transfer stations experienced
            disproportionately high delay durations, and late-day hours contributed most to cumulative
            service impact.
            </p>

            <h4>Modeling & Deliverables</h4>
            <p>
            A Random Forest classification model was developed to predict delay cause categories using
            temporal features and delay duration. Deliverables included cleaned datasets, exploratory
            visualizations, a predictive model, and a written analytical report summarizing findings and
            recommendations.
